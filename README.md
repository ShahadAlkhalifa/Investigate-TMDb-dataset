# Investigate-TMDb-dataset
This project is the second project of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. I chose the TMDb dataset to investigate, analyze, and share my findings.

I used Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. I focused on three questions to derive insights, which are: 
1. Which year had the highest revenue and which year had the lowest revenue?
2. Which movie genre is popular?
3. Is there a relation between revenue and budget?

The notebook includes the full report with my findings and explanations.
